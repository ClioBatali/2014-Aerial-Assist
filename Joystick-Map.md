**Logitech Attack 3:**  

Important: xy axis may not be perfectly calibrated

Observations: Using the Joystick Explorer UI program the Logitech Attack 3 loses inital set values at rest when used. The initial set values are (0) and then change after use.
   * x-axis (1) = stick side to side (all left: = -1 & all right = +1)
   * y-axis (2) = stick forward/back  (all forward = -1 all back +1)
   * z-axis (3) = throttle  (push forward is -1 pull back is +1)
   * Axis(4),(5),(6)are not used 
   * There is no button 12
  
**Logitech Extreme 3D Pro** 

Important: xy axis is not perfectly calibrated at 0
   * x-axis (1)   = stick side to side  (all left = -1 & all right +1)
   * y-axis (2)  = stick forward/back  (forward = - 1 & backward = +1)
   * z-axis (3) = stick twist(twist left=-1 & twist right = +1)
   * small joystick (5) = push button style with -1 left & +1 right (no floating value) 
   * small joystick (6) = push button style with -1 forward & +1 backward
   * throttle (4) = throttle (forward = -1.0, back = 1.0, middle=0)
   * all other buttons (match the printed values)

Side note: the plural of axis is axes.  

**Using Two Joysticks**
   * If your going to use two joysticks, the most recently plugged in one is set to joystick one.
   * You can change this by going into setup and in a panel called joystick setup, you can drag and drop to change the order.
