**Remember to Save\!\!\!\!**  
  
Robot builder is a helpful tool to create a basic framework for a robot of your creation. It is possible to create motor controllers, camera, gyroscope, joystick and button subsystems and inputs, and more! Upon creating a robot in robot builder, it is possible to generate code for the systems you have created in the builder, creating variables for each motor controller and joystick automatically.  
  
**DANGER**  
With automatically generated code comes great responsibility. Generated comments show where automatically generated exists. In those locations, any custom code will be erased in future robot builder code generations. Be very careful writing code here!
