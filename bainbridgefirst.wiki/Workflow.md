Anyone on the Bainbridge FIRST team can ask me personally to be added as a contributor. Contributor requests should be processed off-repo in the Facebook group.

The main branch of this repository should contain compilable, functioning code. Contributors should fork this repository into their own GitHub accounts and make sure to pull changes frequently. Code on this repo should be updated by [issuing a pull request through GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Development should be considered to fall under the "Fork & Pull" method, which you can read about at the link above. Other developers will be added as contributors to the main repository, but feature changes **must** be issued through pull requests to allow for pre-merge discussion by the whole development team.
